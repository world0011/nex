<h1 align="center">Nex</h1>

Nex is a **remote system management tool** built with Python that integrates with Discord for simple cross-platform control.  
It provides a lightweight way to manage your machines remotely, automate tasks, and monitor system activity through a familiar chat interface.  

This project is based on [Pinkcord](https://github.com/Jvr2022/pinkcord), but has been expanded with additional functionality, cross-platform improvements, and better session handling.
